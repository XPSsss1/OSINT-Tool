# OSINT-Tool
Ultimate OSINT Terminal Hacking Tool



This is a comprehensive, menu-driven Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool designed for the terminal, inspired by the style and functionality of professional tools like RedTiger. It provides a structured, interactive interface for various OSINT categories and their associated tools.üö® IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Early Development & Work in Progress üö®This tool is currently in early development and is being actively improved. While the interface is fully functional and designed for a robust OSINT workflow, please be aware of the following:Simulated vs. Live Data: At this stage, only a few key tools are integrated with real, live OSINT APIs. The majority of the functionalities currently provide simulated/mock data to demonstrate their capabilities and expected output.Functionality Gaps: Some tools, while listed, might not yet have their full real-world API integration implemented.API Key Usage: The tool is designed to read API keys from environment variables for secure and flexible configuration. However, these keys are only utilized by the currently integrated live tools.This tool might not be as polished or feature-complete as a production-ready OSINT solution right now, but it's a strong foundation! We are committed to continuously improving it, adding more live integrations, and refining its capabilities.Stay tuned for updates! Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we work to make this the ultimate OSINT terminal tool.Always ensure you comply with all applicable legal and ethical guidelines when conducting any form of OSINT.FeaturesInteractive Terminal Interface: Navigate through OSINT categories and tools using a clean, text-based menu.External API Key Configuration: Read API keys securely from environment variables, allowing for flexible deployment without modifying the script's core code.Selective Live API Integration:IP Geolocation: Integrated with IPinfo.io for live IP address lookups (requires OSINT_IPINFO_API_KEY).Email Breach Checker: Integrated with HaveIBeenPwned for live email breach checks (requires OSINT_HIBP_API_KEY).Shodan IP Scanner: Integrated with Shodan.io for live IP scanning and service enumeration (requires OSINT_SHODAN_API_KEY).All other tools currently provide simulated data but are ready for future live integration.Comprehensive OSINT Modules: A wide range of tools across various categories, designed to cover diverse OSINT needs.Clear Output: Styled headers, sub-headers, and result formatting for better readability, clearly indicating the data source (REAL API vs. SIMULATED).Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.x installed on your system.The requests Python library. If you don't have it, install it using pip:pip install requests
Setting Up API Keys (Environment Variables)To enable real-time data for the integrated tools, you need to obtain API keys from the respective services and set them as environment variables in your operating system or development environment (like Replit).IPinfo.io API Key: Get your API key from ipinfo.io. Set it as:OSINT_IPINFO_API_KEY=YOUR_IPINFO_KEYHaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) API Key: Get your API key from haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key. Set it as:OSINT_HIBP_API_KEY=YOUR_HIBP_KEYShodan.io API Key: Get your API key from shodan.io/api/account. Set it as:OSINT_SHODAN_API_KEY=YOUR_SHODAN_KEYHow to set environment variables:Linux/macOS (for current terminal session):export OSINT_IPINFO_API_KEY="YOUR_IPINFO_KEY"
export OSINT_HIBP_API_KEY="YOUR_HIBP_KEY"
export OSINT_SHODAN_API_KEY="YOUR_SHODAN_KEY"
# Replace YOUR_..._KEY with your actual keys.
Windows (Command Prompt - for current session):set OSINT_IPINFO_API_KEY="YOUR_IPINFO_KEY"
set OSINT_HIBP_API_KEY="YOUR_HIBP_KEY"
set OSINT_SHODAN_API_KEY="YOUR_SHODAN_KEY"
Windows (PowerShell - for current session):$env:OSINT_IPINFO_API_KEY="YOUR_IPINFO_KEY"
